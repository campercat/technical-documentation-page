    <header>What is JavaScript?</header>
    <p>JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).</p>

<p>JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</p>

<p>JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
  <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
  <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.</li>

    <header>Syntax</header>
    <p>JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:<p>
    <p>The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed values</li>
      <li>Variable values</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Fixed values are called Literals.</p>
    <p>Variable values are called Variables.</p>
    <p>The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Numbers are written with or without decimals:</li>
      <code class="block"
        >10.50
        1001
      </code>
      <li>Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:</li>
      <code class="block"
        >"John Doe"
        'John Doe'
      </code>
    </ol>

    <header>Variables</header>
    <p>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.</p>

    <p>In this example, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>, are variables, declared with the <code>var</code> keyword:</p>
